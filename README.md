- Throughout the world, every single year, 2 billion + birthday cards are sent. Well, that may be quite less considering the total number of people living on earth but we need to consider the fact that birthday cards arenâ€™t popular everywhere in the world. We take a lot of time to generate happy birthday wishes and gifts. So I took the chance to create this telegram bot to help us decrease this time. There are many birthday cards which when opened, play a song or music. These cards use far more computing power compared to what was actually used for sending a man to the moon! So here I want to solve this problem by integrating the mere concept of birthdays with bots.


## To get started with this project you need to get a telegram API key and Cohere API key then 
- To install cohere `pip install cohere`
- For telegram `pip install telegram-python-bot'


This project is made for MLH's Hacking-Birthday-Bash
